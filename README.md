# Prerequisites - game is compatible on all browsers

# Instructions
Test how psychic you are by guessing what letter the computer chose.

The computer randomly chooses a letter between a-z from the computer choice array.

The player has 9 guesses to pick the right letter that the computer chose.

Letters that were previously selected are listed out so that they are not picked again.

If your guess matches the computer's letter, then you win and your win score goes up by 1.

If your guess doesn't match the computer's letter, then the number of guesses goes down by 1.

When the number of guesses reaches 0, it's game over. The number of losses goes up by 1 and the game resets such that the computer randomly chooses a new letter and you get 9 more lives to guess the right letter.
